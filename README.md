## Hi there 👋

<!-- **Panzolinho/Panzolinho** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->


- 🔭 I’m currently on a journey to learn coding. I'm self-taught, using resources like YouTube channels, Udemy courses, W3Schools, Codecademy, and many other helpful websites.
- 🌱 I’m focused on becoming a web and game developer , currently trying to master HTML, CSS and Javascript in 2024.
- 👯 I’m planning to start a YouTube channel to document my journey as a self-taught web developer. I'll share my learning experiences, realizations, and creations, and I'm excited to collaborate with other YouTubers in the future.
